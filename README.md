# whistler-image-downloader

This helper tool was created to make it easier to download and rename images from Whistler App. 
Before using the tool, you need to do the following:
1. If one row contains multiple images, separate them into different columns (can be easily done in Google Sheet)
2. Save the file as CSV and upload it to the script's folder.

This was quickly made for a very specific task, but with few modifications it can be useful for activists working with data collected through this app.
