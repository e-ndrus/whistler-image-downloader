This helper tool was created to make it easier to download and rename images from Whistler App (https://whistlerapp.org/). 

Assume you have a dataset from your campaign with hundreds or thousands of images. Assume you have multiple images in one cell.
It can take you hours to download those images. To make it even worse, files have nonsensical names. 

I wrote this script for myself to download those files quickly and give them some understandable names based on the records in the dataset.

Save the file with your Whistler data as CSV and upload it to the script's folder. Update the script for your own needs.
